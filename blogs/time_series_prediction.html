    <h1>Time Series Prediction for USD/ZAR Using LSTM, RNN, GRU, and ANN Networks</h1>

    <p><strong>By:</strong> Deep Learning & Financial Forecasting Blog</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The USD/ZAR exchange rate is influenced by a wide range of economic and geopolitical factors. While traditional statistical models have been widely used in financial forecasting, deep learning—especially Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)—offers a more powerful tool for capturing patterns over time.</p>

    <h2>Why Deep Learning for Time Series?</h2>
    <p>Time series models must account for temporal dependencies. Deep learning can detect nonlinear trends, cycles, and anomalies without the need for manual feature engineering.</p>

    <div class="note">Traditional linear models often fall short when dealing with the volatility and complexity of financial data.</div>

    <h2>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)</h2>
    <p>RNNs process data sequentially and maintain internal states to remember past inputs. They’re useful for short-term forecasts but struggle with long sequences due to the vanishing gradient problem.</p>
    <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong> Short-term predictions with recent data relevance.</p>

    <h2>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)</h2>
    <p>LSTMs improve upon RNNs by incorporating memory cells and gates that allow the network to retain relevant long-term dependencies.</p>
    <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong> Long-term predictions and macroeconomic trend recognition.</p>

    <h2>Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)</h2>
    <p>GRUs simplify the LSTM architecture by combining the forget and input gates. They retain predictive power while being more efficient.</p>
    <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong> Long-term predictions with faster training time and reduced memory requirements.</p>

    <h2>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)</h2>
    <p>Though not designed for sequential tasks, ANNs can be adapted to time series forecasting with lagged features. However, they generally underperform RNN-based models on temporal data.</p>
    <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong> Short-term pattern recognition and feature extraction.</p>

    <h2>USD/ZAR Forecasting Results (2010–2025)</h2>
    <p>Models were trained from 2010 to 2020 and evaluated on predictions for 2020–2025. Here’s how they performed:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>GRU:</strong> Best accuracy and speed balance</li>
      <li><strong>ANN:</strong> Surprisingly effective for short-term patterns</li>
      <li><strong>RNN:</strong> Moderate performance, limited by sequence length</li>
      <li><strong>LSTM:</strong> Lower performance, possibly due to overfitting</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Between 2010 and 2025, the Rand weakened from 7.30 to nearly 19.75 ZAR/USD, driven by local and global events including the COVID-19 pandemic and economic instability.</p>

    <h2>Sample GRU Code in Keras</h2>
    <pre><code>
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import GRU, Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(GRU(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], X_train.shape[2])))
model.add(GRU(50))
model.add(Dense(1))

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Model selection should consider the forecast horizon, dataset size, and computational resources. GRUs and ANNs may outperform traditional models under the right conditions. Ultimately, deep learning should be combined with financial expertise for best results in forex prediction.</p>
