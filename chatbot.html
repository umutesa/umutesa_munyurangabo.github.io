  <h1>The Quiet Revolution: How Large Language Models Are Changing the Way We Think About Language</h1>

  <p>Not long ago, machines couldn’t hold a conversation, let alone write a story or answer your questions in real-time. That changed with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)—deep learning models trained on massive text corpora to understand, generate, and even reason with human language.</p>

  <h2>What Is a Large Language Model?</h2>
  <p>At its core, an LLM is a type of neural network trained to predict the next word in a sentence. It reads billions of lines of text, learning patterns, syntax, and meaning. This process—called tokenization and embedding—breaks language into digestible pieces and gives each one a numerical identity tied to its context.</p>

  <p>Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, and Quoc V. Le introduced Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) learning with an encoder-decoder structure. Dzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio added attention mechanisms. Ashish Vaswani et al. revolutionized the field with Transformers in "<em>Attention is All You Need</em>" using self-attention to handle relationships in data more efficiently.</p>

  <p>LLMs are built using this transformer architecture. They focus on relevant parts of a sentence regardless of order, which allows them to perform translation, summarization, and more by inferring context.</p>

  <h2>How LLMs Work</h2>
  <p>During training, LLMs predict the next word based on previous ones by analyzing language patterns. Text is tokenized into smaller units and converted into embeddings. This enables LLMs to grasp semantics and conceptual relationships. Once trained, they can generate coherent and relevant text by leveraging these learned patterns.</p>

  <h2>Challenges & Limitations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Overfitting & Memorization:</strong> May recall patterns without understanding them.</li>
    <li><strong>Bias:</strong> Models inherit biases present in training data.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Dependency:</strong> They can't adapt beyond their training corpus.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where Optimization Comes In: My Experience with GPT-2</h2>
  <p>I used GPT-2 as a base model due to its balance of performance and size. Key enhancements included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fine-Tuning:</strong> Trained on specific database content for domain accuracy.</li>
    <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):</strong> Iteratively improved responses based on user ratings.</li>
    <li><strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):</strong> Integrated external PDF data into outputs without retraining.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>When to Choose RAG Over Fine-Tuning</h3>
  <p>RAG is ideal when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your data changes frequently.</li>
    <li>You can't afford expensive retraining cycles.</li>
    <li>You need factual updates without changing the core model.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How RAG Works</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>PDF content is chunked and embedded into a vector database (e.g., ChromaDB).</li>
    <li>A retriever identifies relevant chunks based on the user’s query.</li>
    <li>The prompt is dynamically constructed and sent to the model (e.g., GPT-2/OpenAI).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)</h2>
  <p>RLHF uses human evaluations to fine-tune model performance. The process:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Humans compare model outputs.</li>
    <li><strong>Reward Model:</strong> Predicts preferences based on ratings.</li>
    <li><strong>Fine-Tuning:</strong> Model learns to optimize for human-desired outputs.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Building a UI with Streamlit</h2>
  <p>I created a user interface with <strong>Streamlit</strong> that allows users to interact with the model, ask questions, and view the source documents behind the answers. It provided a clean, intuitive way to explore knowledge through AI.</p>
