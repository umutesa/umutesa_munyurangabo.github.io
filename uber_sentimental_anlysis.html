  <h1>Sentiment Analysis of 2024 Uber Customer Reviews</h1>

  <p>Customer feedback plays a crucial role in shaping any service-oriented company, and Uber is no exception. With thousands of riders using the service daily, analyzing customer reviews 
    can provide valuable insights into satisfaction levels, areas for improvement, and overall brand perception. 
This project comprehensively explores sentiment analysis on 2024 Uber customer reviews. The approach integrates advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with deep learning models.</p>

  <h2>Preparing the Dataset: Cleaning and Processing Uber Reviews</h2>




Effective sentiment analysis begins with careful data preparation. The dataset for this project consists of thousands of Uber customer reviews from 2024,
  including user ratings, comments, and timestamps. 

<b>  Data Cleaning : </b>

Irrelevant columns were removed. Reviews that were incomplete or empty were also filtered out.

 <b> Text Preprocessing : </b>

All reviews were standardized by converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation's and HTML tags, and performing spelling corrections. 
Emojis were replaced with descriptive text (e.g., üòÉ ‚Üí ‚Äúhappy‚Äù). To further refine the text, lemmatization reduced words to their base forms, and common stop words such as 
  is, the, and and were eliminated.

    <h2>Insights based on popular and least common  words </h2>

    <p> A word cloud generated from the reviews showed that positive adjectives like ‚Äúgood,‚Äù ‚Äúgreat,‚Äù and ‚Äúnice‚Äù were among the most 
    frequent, suggesting that the bulk of reviews were positive. 
    Meanwhile, words that appeared less often were either out of context or seemed to reference very specific entities, like driver's name or location. </p>

  <h2>Using Deep Models for Sentiment Analysis</h2>

  <p>To extract meaningful sentiment trends, I experimented with three state-of-the-art models:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>VADER (SentimentIntensityAnalyzer)</i> ‚Äì A rule-based sentiment tool that assigns positive, negative, or neutral scores. While fast and efficient, VADER struggles with complex reviews that contain sarcasm or indirect sentiments.</li>
    <li><i>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)</i> ‚Äì A deep learning model that understands word relationships in context. BERT excels at capturing nuanced meanings, making it ideal for analyzing customer emotions in detailed reviews.</li>
    <li><i>BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)</i> ‚Äì A model capable of understanding past and future word relationships. By processing reviews bidirectionally, BiLSTM improves accuracy when interpreting sentence structures that express mixed sentiments.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Final thoughts</h2>

  The analysis revealed distinct patterns across different customer groups. Riders who gave positive reviews frequently praised "friendly drivers," "comfortable rides," and "quick pickups." 
  In contrast, negative reviews highlighted concerns such as "long wait times," "poor vehicle quality," and "rude interactions with drivers".
  While VADER worked well for quick sentiment evaluation, it often misinterpreted emotionally charged reviews. 
  BERT performed the best, accurately recognizing customer emotions even when reviews contained irony or indirect complaints. 
  BiLSTM showed strong performance, but its computational requirements made it less practical for real-time analysis.


  <h2>Actionable Recommendations Based on Negative Sentiment</h2>

  <p> 
    Our analysis uncovered opposing feedback patterns between pleased and frustrated customer groups. Positive reviews frequently mentioned ‚Äúfriendly drivers,‚Äù ‚Äúcomfortable rides,‚Äù and ‚Äúquick pickups.‚Äù
    Conversely, negative reviews raised concerns about ‚Äúlong wait times,‚Äù ‚Äúpoor vehicle quality,‚Äù and ‚Äúrude driver interactions.‚Äù High dissatisfaction around driver conduct or slow service points to the need for refined driver guidelines and better route optimization.
      Errors in pick-up or destination coordinates disrupt journeys and cause delays. Enhancing GPS technology and allowing users to confirm locations could lessen these issues.
      Frequent cancellations result in irregular wait times and undermine trust. Stricter cancellation policies and enhanced driver training may provide relief.
      Multiple charges or unexpected fees, often tied to driver lateness, sap customer confidence. Transparent billing practices and clear communication may restore trust.
  </p>

  <p>Based on negative feedback trends, Uber could implement the following solutions:</p>
  <ul>

      <li>
    <i>Reduce Wait Times:</i> Optimize routing algorithms and driver availability. Drivers should be permitted to pick up trips only when they are within 5 minutes of arrival, accounting for traffic.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Improve Vehicle Quality:</i> Enforce stricter vehicle inspection policies focused on hygiene, safety, and user comfort. Implement vehicle tracking so that drivers are required to adhere to designated speed limits.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Billing Transparency:</i> Audit pricing algorithms and establish a user-friendly dispute resolution process. For example, charge customers only once a trip has started (i.e., when the driver picks them up) rather than including waiting time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Address Location Accuracy:</i> Enhance GPS precision for pick-up locations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Minimize Driver Cancellations:</i> Implement stricter cancellation policies for drivers, such as a penalty fee for frequent trip cancellations.
  </li>

  </ul>
